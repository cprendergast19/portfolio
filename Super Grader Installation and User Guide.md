## Weighted Grading


Super Grader supports up to 6 weighted scores. The sum of the sections percentage values cannot exceed 100. Exceeding 100 will force a reset. It displays the running percentage total at the top of the screen.

To begin select S1 (Section 1) and scroll the percentage wheel to the required percentage. Next, scroll the score wheel to the required score.

Repeat this process until the sum of the sections is equal to 100. Once this total percentage is 100, it displays the weighted grade at the bottom of the screen alongside the final score. Fig 7 shows an example of the weighted grade screen.
