# I​n Training for the Culinary Olympics in NOLA

I​f you haven't been to New Orleans, you have no doubt heard of it, and even thought about visiting. I finally made the trip this past weekend to see what exactly all the fuss was about and I have to say I was not disappointed!

B​eing a self confessed foodie, the focus on my trip was indeed food.. Fortunately for me I was with a group of like minded peeps. With so many options its hard to know where to go and what to eat where. Luckily my friends had indeed been many times before to this food mecca, and endulged us with an award winning food and drink tour of this great city.

O​ne of the many highlights of the trip has to be these chargrilled oysters topped with lump crab that we had at [Bourbon House](http://www.bourbonhouse.com/).

B​ourbon Street has many iconic bars, one that shouldn't be missed on your trip is the [](https://hotelmonteleone.com/entertainment/carousel-bar/)[Carousel Bar](https://hotelmonteleone.com/entertainment/carousel-bar/) (located inside Hotel Monteleone). There's limited seating at the actual bar but it's worth the wait! The bar itself rotates slowly, this combined with fantastic cocktails makes it a very cool pit stop indeed. The Pimms cup was exceptionally good here, as was the piña colada.

A​nother fine find was [Molly's](https://www.mollysatthemarket.net/), it was here that we had in my opinion the best cocktail of the trip.. Molly's famous frozen Irish coffee. So good we went back for another one.

S​eeking more oysters, we ventured to Felix's, another great establishment that again did not disappoint! More casual in setting than Bourbon House but don't let that fool you, the chargrilled oysters were delicious, oozing in garlic butter and served with a hunk of crusty bread. What's not to like? You can't go wrong with a Pimms cup here to wash them down, quite frankly it would be rude not to. The cup of jambalaya here was also very good.

W​ith a multitude of food options in the French Quarter, its hard to go wrong really. There truly is something for everyone.
