## Interoffice Memorandum
 

**From:** Claire Prendergast

**To: Brian Smith, Manager**

**Date:** September 1, 2018

**Subject:** Feasibility of Joining a Corporate Wellness Program


## **Introduction**

To improve morale, relieve stress and increase energy and fitness within the company it has been proposed that we promote employee fitness. Joining a corporate wellness program would achieve this goal. A corporate wellness program is the modern-day version of a health club membership. Together with the technology available to track our fitness (e.g. Fitbit, Apple Watch, Jawbone UP, Max Buzz Tracker), there are multiple corporate wellness programs in which companies can enroll their employees in. These programs can offer incentives for tiered achievements and are great motivational tools that improve both employee fitness and morale.

## **Options Considered**

The programs that were considered are Jiff Launch Pad, Virgin Pulse Global Challenge and Fitbit Wellness Program. All three options are very similar in price.

Jiff Launch Pad offers a comprehensive wellness program however; the program has many more features than we are looking for. It would need a much more involved approach to managing the system and requires integration with HR.

Virgin Pulse Global Challenge requires the company to divide into teams of seven to participate in a global challenge for 100 days. Although this will offer incentive, our primary goal is to encourage and motivate our employees, splitting up into small teams may not achieve this goal. Another factor is the longevity of the program, after the initial 100 days’ employee enthusiasm may wane if there’s no longer anything to focus on.

Fitbit offers a program that is well established and easy to use and maintain. The program allows employees to seamlessly register and participate in fitness challenges.

## **Solution**

The company that I am recommending is Fitbit. As one of the leading companies in fitness tracking they offer high quality trackers and polished software. Fitbit is a well-established company. Fitbit offers a discount to the company to provide trackers to employees, this is based on the company contributing at least 25% to the trackers for the employees. Their devices maintain a long charge for up to a week unlike many of their competitors. The Fitbit Wellness Program is a proven way to encourage employees to be more active and reach their health and fitness goals.

To encourage employees to participate in the program they will be provided with a credit to easily purchase a tracker from our customized Fitbit store front. Existing Fitbit trackers can easily be integrated with the system should employees already own one and prefer to use it.

The Fitbit Wellness Program has a Program Management Dashboard for 250+ employees. This has automatic onboarding via serial numbers on the devices (i.e. upon registration and activation the Fitbit device is automatically enrolled in our corporate wellness program allowing employees to participate in the challenges). The dashboard also offers export capabilities allowing us to configure the date range, internal communication features, and the ability to assign employees to teams and administer competitions.

A dedicated Customer Success team member will be assigned to help implement the program, they will assist in onboarding employees and providing continuous program support and evaluation of participation.

A demo of the wellness program is available on the Fitbit Health Solutions website https://fitbit.wistia.com/medias/7f1qa9lorv. The software provides a customizable news feed for the employees which includes fitness articles and encouragement. The feed can also be used by employees to post their success stories and motivate each other.

Engagement data and activity level insights are provided by the software allowing the program administrator to easily evaluate progress and performance. Using the software provided, the administrator can quickly view data on the following:

-   Participation levels using percentages of employees meeting, exceeding or not achieving goals
-   Individual and group level data reporting steps, floors climbed, active minutes and distance
-   Challenge results and activity level data
-   Trends in activity, e.g. Are employees more active during and just after a challenge than before a challenge?

  

## **Incentives**

Success can be greatly increased by incentivizing challenges. As a company, we could potentially offer prizes for the winners of individual/team challenges. Example prizes could

include the following: Dinner gift cards, Amazon gift cards, team night out, team lunch, team dinner, paid leave day(s), and event tickets.

## **Cost**

500 fitness tracker credits of $50 costing $25,000.

Annual subscription $10,000.

Example discounted prices based on 25% contribution by our organization

Fitbit Ionic: $255/unit

Fitbit Versa: $170.00/unit

Fitbit Charge 3 - $127.50/unit

Fitbit Flex 2 - $50.00/unit

Fitbit Zip - $50.00/unit

## **Setup Timeline**

It will take one week to setup and configure our corporate wellness system. This will involve creating teams, configuring challenges, configuring marketing materials, and generating articles for health and wellness to be used on our company news feed.

When purchased, the trackers will be shipped directly to the employees’ addresses to help expedite the setup process. Once the trackers are activated they are automatically added to our corporate wellness system.

## **Conclusion**

Enrolling in such a plan will greatly benefit our organization in many ways. Primarily it will enhance the work/life balance of our employees. The employee morale, fitness and energy levels will most certainly increase by becoming more active and participating in challenges.

Providing subsidized/free trackers ensures that everyone can participate. This all-inclusive wellness program enables people of all fitness levels to participate, creating a company culture that is both healthy and social.

Financially the company has the potential to save money on healthcare, with fitter employees there will be less medical expenses.

To proceed with this course of action please respond by September 30th 2018.
